# MCP Server Operator

**Operational security guidance tool for MCP server deployment and maintenance. Provides advisory-only guidance for secure configuration, deployment, and ongoing operational hygiene of Model Context Protocol servers.**

## Overview

MCP Server Operator is a comprehensive operational security advisor designed to help users safely deploy, configure, and maintain MCP servers in production environments. Unlike enforcement-based security tools, this server takes an advisory-only approachâ€”it doesn't proxy traffic or enforce policies at runtime, but instead guides users through secure deployment practices, risk assessments, and ongoing operational hygiene.

The tool serves as your operational security consultant, providing expert guidance on how to configure, wrap, and monitor MCP server deployments securely. It bridges the critical gap between "the server is secure" and "the deployment is secure" by offering recommendations and best practices for secure operations.

## Key Features
